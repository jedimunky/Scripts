Note:

1. To start working with Control-M/Agent 9.0.18.200, you must close
 the current session and open a new one.

2. If you plan to run jobs whose owner is different than 'CMAgent',
perform the following steps after exiting the installation:
a. Login as root user, execute the '/home/CMAgent/ctm/scripts/set_agent_mode' script
and enable non-root mode.
b. Define job owners passwords in Control-M using CCM or ctmsetown utility.

3. If you want the agent to start as user 'CMAgent' when the host is restarted,
implement the '/home/CMAgent/ctm/scripts/rc.agent_user' script
or replace any existing startup script with it.
For more information, refer to the Installation Guide.
