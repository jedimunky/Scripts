Powershell for DB2 scripts

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

This past half year (Jan 2018)
* Spotlight, monitoring Siebel Production 24x7 on overhead screen, used to spot low disk space, high disk I/O, and rogue threads.
* Data Server Manager, monitoring all other Db2 production systems, 24x7 on overhead screen, used for availability and process checking.
* MongoDB for Sitecore, deployed to production in 3 replica set, secured, recoverable and highly available, has already recorded 0.5 million interactions.
* NetBackup, configured for all v10+ non-production environments, saving disk space (99% de-duplication), and running much faster than before.
* PowerShell, used for NetBackup, log archiving and deleting, and a host of other useful scripts.
* Refresh process (old), automated with Control-M reducing manual involvement and run times.

Post Jan 2018
* Performance tuning, identified and fixed a number of poor performing production SQL queries.
* NetBackup, implemented throttling to prevent overloading of network and appliance.
